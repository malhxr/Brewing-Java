Founded in 2001 by Alberto “Beto” Perez, the dance classes range from low and moderate, to high-intensity intervals that help support coordination, balance, and agility. Can beginners go to a Zumba class? Yes, beginners are of course encouraged to take Zumba® classes! In each class, the fitness instructor will provide modifications and move adjustments so that everyone can enjoy and feel confident in their dance moves. Does Zumba dancing help you lose weight? While Zumba® classes are a great way to get in extra cardio, the class alone will not aid in weight loss unless you combine it with a caloric deficit and a few days of strength training! What are the benefits of Zumba? Zumba® is a great cardio option for those who don’t like traditional cardio workouts like running, biking, or rowing. Cardio is great for helping to reduce blood pressure, lower risk of heart disease, and improving mental wellbeing.
