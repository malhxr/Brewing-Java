Truly, after a long ride on the spin bike or an exciting power lift session, there’s nothing better than 15 -30 minutes of true self-care time where you can focus solely on you. The best part? All fitness levels can benefit from HydroMassage therapy. This amazing muscle recovery method is perfect for beginners and professional athletes, alike. You can even control your own session with pressure, speed, and massage area controls that are designed to give you the type of massage you want and need. Available with select memberships, HydroMassage lounges use heated water to provide a relaxing, rejuvenating experience. Sit back and let the water pressure relieve muscle soreness, provide temporary relief of minor aches and pains, increase circulation, reduce stress and anxiety, and promote deep relaxation. We recommend using the HydroMassage beds at least 2x a week to experience the full benefits. Whether you have done a tough workout, had a stressful week, or simply need some time to focus on yourself, HydroMassage is always the answer.
