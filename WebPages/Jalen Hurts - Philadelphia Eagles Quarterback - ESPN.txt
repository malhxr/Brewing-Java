Spin: In the three games prior to the team's Week 10 bye, Hurts tended to a left knee injury that forced him to wear a brace for the final two outings. Hurts told EJ Smith of The Philadelphia Inquirer on Thursday that he used the midseason respite to rest and receive treatment on the knee and that he also didn't wear the brace at Philadelphia's initial session of Week 11 prep. Hurts thus appears set for Monday's rematch of Super Bowl LVII against a Chiefs defense that ranks fifth in the NFL against the pass this season at 176 yards per game. ESPN Fantasy Projection: Hurts returns for his third season as the Eagles' starting QB after a breakout 2022 campaign in which he was in the MVP conversation and led his team to an NFC title. Hurts actually paced all QBs in fantasy points per game (25.2) and was a top-six scorer at the position in eight consecutive weeks. The 25-year-old led all QBs in carries (165) and rush TDs (13), and his heavy goal line role allowed 20 carries inside the opponent's 5-yard line, which ranked second in the entire league. Hurts is set up for success again in 2023, with an elite offensive line and a terrific group of targets led by A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Dallas Goedert. Hurts is, at worst, a top-three fantasy option at the position.
