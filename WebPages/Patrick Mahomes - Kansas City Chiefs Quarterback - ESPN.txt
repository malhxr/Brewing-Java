So much for that. Mahomes proceeded to lead the league in passing yards (career-high 5,242), pass TDs (41) and fantasy points (417) en route to winning league MVP and the Super Bowl. Mahomes' fantasy floor was absurdly high, as his worst weekly finish was 13th in Week 2. He continues to load up the box score through the air and also posted career-high marks in rushing yards (358) and TDs (four) last season. Kansas City's WR room is unproven but has plenty of potential in youngsters Kadaraius Toney, Skyy Moore and Rashee Rice. Mahomes enters his age-27 season locked in as an elite fantasy option in Andy Reid's pass-heavy offense. Latest Videos 0:41 Can Mahomes top 20 fantasy points vs. Eagles on MNF?
