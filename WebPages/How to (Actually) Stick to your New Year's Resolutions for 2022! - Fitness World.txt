January 14, 2022 Written by Hannah New. Satisfying. Exciting. No, we’re not talking about a hot plate of poutine. We’re talking about New Year’s Resolutions! While we absolutely love New Year’s Resolutions and think they are such an important part of a fitness journey, we also know how often (and quickly) they can be broken. According to a study conducted by Strava, most people are likely to give up their resolutions by January 19th! However, this year, that’s not going to happen to you! We’ve created easy-to-follow tips to make sure you can stick to your New Year’s Resolution and become the best you possible! HOW TO STICK TO YOUR NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTIONS New Year’s Resolutions are a great way to map out exactly what you want your goals to be for the year. Maybe you’re looking to lose weight or run for longer. Maybe your goals aren’t even fitness related at all. Do you want to read more? Watch less TV? Your goals are individual to you and your desires. If they’re important to you, then they matter. What a lot of people struggle with, however, is how to accomplish them. For example, if you haven’t run long distance in 10+ years, a New Year’s Resolution to run a marathon is going to be a little too ambitious. That doesn’t mean you should scrap the idea, but it’s important to understand how to manage your resolutions. Let’s take a look at what you should do when writing New Year’s Resolutions, so that you can not only accomplish your resolutions, but stick to them year after year! FWTIPS FOR A SUSTAINABLE NEW YEAR’S RESOLUTION Choose 2-3 Resolutions While it may be more exciting to write out an entire page of resolutions, it’s only that much more disappointing if they don’t get accomplished. Instead, choose 2-3 resolutions that are manageable for you. If you’re already an avid yogi, maybe make a resolution to add a class that complements that, like Pilates or a HIIT class. Don’t start from zero. Instead, add on to what you’re already doing. Pick Something You’re Already Interested In If you hate running, don’t make a resolution to start doing it simply because you want to get more cardio in! Resolutions like this never last because they’re impossible to stick to. Instead, opt for other ways to get your heart rate up, like THE WORX Small Group Training, or cardio classes like Cardio Kickboxing or Indoor Cycling! These are great alternatives and will be more sustainable for you long-term. There’s always a way to accomplish a specific goal you have. If you’re confused about nutrition or fitness goals, meet with a personal trainer who can help create customized goals that work for your lifestyle. Grab a Resolution Buddy! Everything is always more fun when there’s another person doing it with you. For one or all of your fitness resolutions, grab a workout buddy who can keep you accountable. Keep a Progress Journal Take time every day to write down your progress. Even if you’re not where you want to be on your resolution journey, write it down! Seeing a progress report on paper and writing down how you feel about it, can sometimes trigger a re-up of motivation. Be the Tortoise, Not the Hare Finally, it’s important to remember: you’re not going to change your entire routine in a day. While saving $1 a day might sound like nothing, after a year, you suddenly have $365. Nothing that’s worth doing, comes easily. Taking things slower doesn’t mean you’re not making accomplishments or progressing. You are! You’re just doing it in a sustainable, easy-to-manage way that ensures you stick with it.
