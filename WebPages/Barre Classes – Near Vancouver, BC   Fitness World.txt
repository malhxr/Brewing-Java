Barre is a type of workout that uses body weight exercises to tone and engage the muscles. High repetition and low-impact movements combine to create a rhythmic exercise class that can be done by beginners and experts. How often should one go to Barre class? How often you should go to a barre class will depend on your availability, lifestyle, and fitness level, however because barre is great for toning and strengthening muscles, introducing two or more classes per week is an optimal weekly goal. I can’t stand on my toes. How much ballet is incorporated into barre? Ballet is a prominent part of barre, however, if you find yourself struggling with some of the movements, you always have the option to modify. If you can’t stand on your toes, your instructor will advise you to try a modification that is better suited to your abilities. Does Barre help you lose weight? If your goal is weight loss, barre can help you lose weight, however, it isn’t the primary benefit. Barre focuses more on strength training, flexibility, and coordination. For weight loss, we recommend speaking with a Personal Trainer to determine the best way to reach your goals that still fits your lifestyle. Can a beginner take a Barre Class? Barre is the perfect exercise class for beginners because it focuses on low-impact movements as well as strength and flexibility. You don’t need to bring any equipment for barre, which is great for new members.
