Kelce set new career-best marks in targets, receptions and TDs and has now finished no lower than second among TEs in catches, yards and fantasy points each of the past seven seasons. Incredibly, Kelce was a top-10 fantasy scorer in 76% of his games, whereas only two other tight ends were over 50%. Kansas City didn't make any major offseason adds at wideout, so Kelce remains locked in as Patrick Mahomes' top target. Kelce is the clear-cut No. 1 TE in fantasy and the 33-year-old should be selected in the middle of the first round in drafts. Latest Videos 0:51 How will Travis Kelce fare against Eagles' defense?
