For beginners, we recommend our pedal party class, which will give you the best of both worlds when it comes to heart-pumping cardio and strength training. We recommend letting your cycling instructor know that you’re a beginner so they can offer modifications and seat adjustments. How often should one go to a spin class? This will depend on your current activity level and availability. As cycling is a great cardio workout, we recommend going at least once a week in order to experience the numerous benefits, including increased cardiovascular endurance, improved sleep, and more! Can a beginner go to a cycling class? Yes! Beginners are encouraged to attend cycling classes. To find out what cycling class would be best for you, head in to your FW location today and speak to one of our certified personal trainers. Do spinning classes help you with weight loss? While spinning is an excellent form of cardio, it is not the defining factor behind weight loss. Combined with a calorie deficit, spinning classes can definitely help you with weight loss if that’s your goal. I’m over 60 years old. Are spin classes recommended for seniors? Yes, however, we recommend speaking to one of our cycling instructors first in order to better understand your fitness activity level. This will help to avoid injury.
