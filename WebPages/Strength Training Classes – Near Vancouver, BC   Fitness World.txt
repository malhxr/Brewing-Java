Strength training is a form of exercise that uses resistance (both in body weight or with separate, external weights) in order to increase muscle mass, build stronger bones, and improve quality of life. It is also commonly referred to as “resistance training.” How often should I do strength training? How often you do strength training per week will depend on your fitness level. For beginners, two days a week of fitness training is perfect, however for more experienced weight lifters, 4+ times a week is also perfectly fine. What are the benefits of Strength Training? There are numerous benefits to strength training that involve more than simply “building muscle.” Introducing strength training into a workout routine helps to decrease the risk of injury, control body fat, regulate mood, and reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Does Strength Training make you gain or lose weight? Strength training will neither help you lose or gain weight if you’re not following a calorie goal. If you’re strength training and are in a caloric surplus, you will gain muscle. If you are strength training and are in a caloric deficit, you will build lean muscle, but also lose fat. What if I’m late to a class? We do understand that things happen and you can’t always be there on time, however, we strongly recommend that you show up 5-15 minutes early for each class in order to prevent any distractions for our yogis and the instructor. If you are late, we please ask that you walk in silently and find a place to get started.
