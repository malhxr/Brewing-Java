Kickboxing classes offer numerous benefits, including improved cardiovascular strength, improved muscle tone, increased energy, better sleep, and more! As kickboxing combines cardio and strength training, you’re getting the benefits of both. Can a beginner go to a kickboxing class? Yes! Kickboxing is for all activity levels, including beginners! As kickboxing moves can be modified for inclusivity, we recommend speaking to the fitness class instructor first to let them know you’re just starting out. Does kickboxing help you lose weight? While kickboxing does have elements of cardio within the exercise, it’s not an effective weight-loss activity on its own. If you’re looking to lose weight, combining kickboxing with a calorie deficit can help you achieve your goals. Do you offer women’s only kickboxing? At the moment, we do not offer women’s only kickboxing, however, if there is a strong desire for it in the future, we would be open to creating a women’s only kickboxing class.
